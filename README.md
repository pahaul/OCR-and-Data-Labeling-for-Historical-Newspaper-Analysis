# Time-Series-Preprocessing-for-Neural-Network-Training-Proof-of-Concept-
This repository serves as a proof-of-concept demonstrating the data pipeline required to prepare raw time-series sensor data for ingestion into a custom-built deep learning model.
Although the model training was paused to prioritize foundational data engineering tasks, the project showcases the construction of robust data transformation and model architecture components using PyTorch.
